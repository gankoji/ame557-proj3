Taingong-1 reentered Earth's atmosphere and fell to its demise on
April 2, 2018, approximately 00:15 UTC. The TLE data and observations
from which we built this integration occurred on January 12, 2018,
which puts the time between our observations and the demise of the
actual satellite at roughly 80 days.

Numerical integration of the equations of motion, including oblateness
and drag disturbances on the vehicle (incorporating drag coefficient
information from the BSTAR term of the 1/12/18 TLE), shows a demise
time of approximately 153 days from the observation epoch, or roughly
June 14, 2018.

It appears that the BSTAR drag term reported by the 1/12/18 TLE was
significantly underestimating the true drag experienced by the
spacecraft.

Final results of the simulation are as follows:
python NumericalIntegration.py
Mean Motion: 0.00116228454858
Orbital Period: 5405.89248549
Initial Radius: 6652.093445817603
Initial Velocity: 7.743944454389337

Crashed 153.06440721368892 days after epoch.

The coordinates of the crash site were determined using *eci2lla* from
MATLAB's aerospace toolbox as:

Lat: 35.6174522281136
Lon: -176.056778303071
Alt: 7186.99016111251

This puts the crash site in the north pacific, about 100 miles
northwest of Hawaii. (See picture of google earth with pin at crash
site). Note that there is an error of approximately 7 km in our
altitude at crash, due to the oblateness of the earth (we assumed a
spherical model with equatorial radius in the simulation).

Input/Output from matlab:

Discussion on how we know our results are okay:

1) Orbital energy decays as expected due to drag. This is plotted for
both the disturbed case and a reference case in which the disturbances
were nulled. Shows that our simulation wasn't throwing away orbital
energy on it's own. (Note that python plots are a little funky, and
for these plots it shows a difference of like .000061-.000062 over
time, but that's *individual units*, and the scale of the orbital
energy in this plot is like 1e7.

2) The altitude plot (I've included a good closeup) shows oscillations
due to the eccentricity of the orbit, until the satellite actually
reenters the atmosphere, where we can see the altitude take a steep
decline as it hurdles toward the surface.

3) Magnitudes of distrubance accelerations all seem acceptable, given
the parameters we had as inputs. No crazy large or small
accelerations.
